# Tahmid Choudhury

**Software & DevOps Engineer | AWS | Docker | CI/CD | React | Node.js**

I build scalable, cloud-native applications and infrastructure with a focus on delivering real-world impact.  
From AI-powered route safety maps to offline-first medical data pipelines, I’ve shipped solutions that solve real problems — fast.

## 🌄 What Drives Me

I’m passionate about **building end-to-end products** — from user-facing apps to the infrastructure that powers them.  
I thrive in hackathon and startup environments where rapid learning, automation, and resilience under pressure are key.

Every project here represents **self-directed learning** — built in my own time, without mentorship, and often under intense deadlines.
